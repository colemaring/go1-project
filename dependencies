According to Unitree these are the dependencies needed to use the legged sdk.
  Boost (version 1.5.4 or higher)
  CMake (version 2.8.3 or higher)
  g++ (version 8.3.0 or higher)

However you'll explicitly need Boost version 1.5.4, you can get that by running the following

apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
apt install -y wget git build-essential libboost-all-dev cmake
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.54.0/boost_1_54_0.tar.gz/download -O boost_1_54_0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf boost_1_54_0.tar.gz
cd boost_1_54_0
./bootstrap.sh
./b2
./b2 install
